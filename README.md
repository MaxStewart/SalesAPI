 - The Services are implemented using the Jooby framework

- A client needs to be able to get all sales for a specific customer.
- A client needs to be able to get a summary of the sale data for a specific customer.
- A client needs to be able to delete a sale.
 
 Customer Service
 -------------
 The service supports the following operations:
- A client needs to be able to create a new customer account.
- A client needs to be able to update the details of an existing account.
- A client needs to be able to get all registered customer accounts.
- A client needs to be able to delete a customer account.
 
 This was a project that I completed without a git repository and now I have decided to put it on github for safe keeping.
 
 The specifications for the project can be found in the file **"ProjectSpecs.pdf"** in the root of the repo.
